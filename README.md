# generate_hospital_names_using_ai

It is a code that I have written to predict the hospital names based on given seed.

For e.g. : If someone want that their hospital name should start with character "A" or "Amity". But they have no idea what should be the full name of hospital. So this helps them to predict hospital names based on the given seed.

You can check out the code and reach me at shlokparmar19143@gmail.com for any query or suggestions.
